Anxiety is a monster that grows bigger when we feed it with Avoidance.

Thoughts that stop me from pursuing a relationship:
I don't deserve. I'm not good enough for. 

Should I pursue anyway?

Secondary effects of avoidance I might subconsciously desire: sympathy and attention from loved ones. But mom worries, so this would be an effect I don't want. I avoid talking about it; sounds like a perfect plan to ruin my life and mom's.

To Change and grow, Replace everything; Glenn was talking about the generational cycle of Abuser-Abused-Abuser, but it applies to me too.

Start body on path to health, that will improve thought and feeling. Can't think myself healthy.

Expander Compressor on the emotion in my life? I didn't realize I was depressed. I don't feel as happy about stuff as others do. Dan asked if it was different with Yvette : yes, higher highs & a very low low. 

Ask more people for help. Nancy? Kate?

I should only do a Project if it's My Idea. If I accept mom's idea, I won't do it.

I need one or more people to talk to about each area of life - finances, weight/health, etc. I need to talk to My People (friends, family) and discover (organically) who fits each topic. 
Eventually I'll tell Dan, "I've got My People, I don't need you now."

Things to think about.

Does AA anxiety mean I can't have 1 thing I'm avoiding, like an alcholoic can't have 1 drink? If I haven't done anything with a project since the last review, then I either do it that day/hour or I put the project on hold?

Notes from listening to the recording made 20120102.

DAN: I don't think there's trauma and injury and damage and those kinds of things. I do think there is some component of "I don't want to grow up and take adult authority & responsibility and move on with my life". ... All human beings have to face [adult authority & responsibility] sometime between 16 & 80. 

Initial Diagnosis: 
Initially, when we first started, it was Depression and Anxiety. In other words, Major Depression at a mild level, recurrent. Then it was anxiety with many flavors of anxiety, General anxiety, social anxiety, obsessive compulsive features to the anxiety, post-trauma features to the anxiety. And the depression in essence resolved and went away sometime last summer, and so the anxiety component is still very much alive and well. That's why I keep talking about avoidance.

{I ask if there's an end to anxiety}
At this stage, ... whenever a person has experienced different forms of anxiety physiologically in the body, the fight/flight stuck on too high a level, for more than 4 out of 7 days a week, for six months, it's always gonna be in their body physiologically. And so, therefore, what our goal is, is coming to a system of managing that where we're controling our lives instead of the anxiety and avoidance controling our lives. 

ME: So, essentially, I'm an alcoholic.

DAN: Yes!
 _ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _ 
I am avoiding things I know I need to do. (What things? Be specific.) I don't know how much o care about these things, but I am avoiding them. 




Project: I want to move, and I haven't for several years.
Channels of parallel accomplishment over the next few years.

I am passive aggressive. 

Dad: 7 to 10 years old, told me to hurry up while walking, and I slowed down. 
Kate: I'll say yes, and my body radiates NO. "You can't control me, I'll do what I want."
Mom: If she told me to do something, I would never consider it, or I would do the opposite.
3 years old. 

I try to be wysiwyg, but I am not - at least with my family.

What can I do to restore my trust in myself?


2011-03-20 - 14:33:11 - Sunday
I see myself as a lazy failure, and therapy won't help.

Soul-Sucking Job - needs to change.

DAN: I think I'm Extrinsically Motivated - how do I work with that?
DAN: How do I cope with this Leaky Roof right now?
DAN: How do I allow myself to make mistakes & not jump down my own throat?
DAN: I am surrounded by reminders of my failures, and they depress me and demotivate me and keep me from trying. 
DAN: How do I "work through" things? (KC says think about it, chewing my cud.)

Don't call myself stupid or the like.

KC: "If something is human nature it shouldn't be held against us."


2011-03-27 - 14:40:01 - Sunday
I betrayed N&E, and was betrayed by SOTERIA.
Talk to them about that, confess my betrayal, hear from them whether they blame me.

I am miserable. 

Ask foreign born naturalized citizens: Why did you become a citizen?


2011-04-17_15-00-20
My lazy is apparently very big.

KC: something is keeping me behind the lazy threshold / or not pushing over the lazy threshold (being lazy is serving me in some way)

TC: offered to help me move/pre-move

KC said that she thinks there's something deep-seated preventing me from being as good as I can be. Or my behavior is serving some need. (Being over-weight has prevented men from treating her as a woman, and treating her as a woman. They don't see her as an attractive woman, they see her as a person.)

This section was from a note titled Working On It, added Monday 25 October 2010 at 06:29 - before I started seeing Dan.

gave up on class without dropping out
Thats not fair.

Consider "fishy" ideas as intellectual problems, not attempts to manipulate.

pretend introspective: Do I want to make these changes? Not "I should".

What is the family's role for this change? Define the role. What do to support, & help - when I'm sliding & being lazy - to get me back on track? 

What do I want to accomplish? (re-do the 6 GTD levels)

I sacrificed who I am to her, "Who Chris Is" was tossed away & changed. 
(Betrayed myself, God, and my family by dating Yvette.)
Will it happen again? Do I trust myself?
A reinforcement of my hatred of manipulation?

@productiveENTP

If you don’t make time for yourself, there’s a good chance that your subconscious will take you hostage and do it for you

It’s possible to have an avoidant streak and have no idea that you have it, because you avoid recognising it or admitting that to yourself (maybe except ironically, via memes, etc)

It’s useful to articulate your conflicts of interest. Eg if you’re smoker and you want to be healthy, it’s good to acknowledge the truth about each. That you enjoy the pleasure of stimulants and that you want to be attractive. It’s hard to recalibrate your life without the truth

Some people get stuck in a trap with sleep - they haven’t been productive, and they’re tired, and they feel like they need to “earn their sleep” by getting some work done first. But they’re too sleepy to be productive so it just gets worse

The problem here is actually a sort of faulty puritanical mindset, a sort of detention/suffering attitude. Suffering for your sins doesn’t actually mean your life will get better. Forgive yourself and go to sleep
