"With the right elements your bucket list can become a moral compass that drives difficult changes by helping you realize that what you want most is going to require you to sacrifice what you want at the moment." - Howard

To quote Howard Tayler:

>Resolutions are kind of useless. We make 'em, we break 'em, we plod ahead regardless. Change is difficult.

>Bucket lists are a little more useful. We examine our lives, and what we want to put into them before we kick the bucket. With the right elements your bucket list can become a moral compass that drives difficult changes by helping you realize that what you want most is going to require you to sacrifice what you want at the moment. 

>Realizing you're on track to accomplish your life goals is what a bucket-list is for. ... It's not wishful thinking. These are things I can do, that I'm already mostly on track to do. I just need to make small changes here and there. 

>I don't need to make any resolutions. I just need to maintain my resolve.
