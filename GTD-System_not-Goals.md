Dr. Drang, May 2018
At the beginning of every month, I make a new TaskPaper document, filling it with the uncompleted tasks from the previous month. In this way, the documents from the previous months are a record of what I was planning to do and what I finished.

- [ ] Thursday :

Cut a block of time from each day to address The Long Term. 
Flexibility on : 
- [ ] block size, 
- [ ] today vs tomorrow vs next week (Do Not skip a 2nd week.)
- [ ] but keep track of when I skipped, it's a signal of overload I can use with Management
