Daily "bread" word study - The advice to live one day at a time for alcoholics and addicts (don't drink today; don't think about tomorrow until you've finished the day without a drink) works well for living with God - talk to Him today and ask for his help today. When the Lord's prayer says give us this day our daily bread, is there anything in that phrase which could mean more than physical food?

God loves me in my sin - when I'm sinning. I can confess mid-sin.

Love as Energy?

Love is neither created or destroyed. It is transformed. 
I transform gods love for me into love for you. 
I can't love on my own, it's like mass flow in a pipe, I need a source.

(from Rabbi Lapin on GBTV)

Religion answers these 3 questions:

1. Where did we come from?
2. Where are we going?
3. What are we supposed to do with our lives?

Secular Fundamentalism answers them this way:

1. Swamp
2. Back to the swamp. Disaster. Hopelessness. Global Warming. 
3. Whatever feels good. Sacraments. Save the planet. Sacrificing. Everything I can do to stave off the #2 Disaster. Build a national government to stave off #2. Or an international government.

Judeo Christian faith answers them this way:

1. God created us.
2. Back to an eternal existence.
3. Service, be better tomorrow than today.
