Bungie Campaign Design Lead Chris Opdahl responding to a reader question about how smooth developing Halo: Reach was. Published 2010 July 23 as part of the Weekly Update.

Communication was pretty strong on Reach (although I can’t speak to it in relation to the previous Halo games). For me, the most important parts of communication are: 1) people know which decisions are being made 2) people know why those decisions are made and 3) people know who is responsible for making those decisions. If those basic criteria are met then people have enough ability to track down what is going on and can have a voice. Not meeting those basic criteria mean that people get blindsided by decisions and/or don’t feel like they can affect change because they don’t know what is going on or who to talk to.
