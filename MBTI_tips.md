## Self-Care for Each Myers-Briggs® Personality Type

https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/09/18/self-care-myers-briggs-personality-type/

### ENTP Self-Care

ENTPs are known for their enterprising, intellectual nature. These visionaries are driven to see the potential of every possibility that crosses their mind. They tend to be optimists, and according to the MBTI® Manual they have lower stress than almost all of the other personality types (besides ESTPs). Self-care for ENTPs means making time for creativity, getting alone time to fully utilize their auxiliary thinking function, and maintaining their physical wellness. Because ENTPs have inferior Introverted Sensing (Si) they tend to forget to take care of their physical needs as they pursue endless ideas and possibilities.

Self-Care Ideas for ENTPs:

– Go out driving with no particular destination in mind.
– Catch up on sleep.
– Make sure you’re eating healthy and at regular intervals.
– Explore new music or play an instrument.
– Play a strategy game or solve a brainteaser.
– Learn something new (watch a TED Talk or find a new idea to explore).
– Play a sport with some friends.
– Play a favorite computer or video game.
– Read a book.

## How Each Myers-Briggs® Type Reacts to Stress (and How to Help!)

https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/08/02/how-each-mbti-type-reacts-to-stress-and-how-to-help/

ENTP – The Inventor

What stresses out an ENTP:

– An environment where rules are rigidly enforced
– A lack of change or progression
– A lack of outside stimulation
– Being micromanaged
– Having their creativity stifled
– Being forced to make decisions or complete projects before they’re ready
– Working with individuals they view as incompetent
– Not having their visions appreciated
– Having their principles violated
– Having to focus too long on mundane details
– Overextending themselves

When an ENTP is experiencing stress, they become distracted and overwhelmed, losing their signature “can do” attitude. They may feel incompetent, inept, and inadequate. They can become overwhelmed with fear, panic, and anxiety and will feel a need to escape whatever situation is plaguing them. Their creativity will be stifled, and if the stress isn’t handled they will fall into the grip of their inferior function, introverted sensing. When they fall into the grip of their inferior function, they will become uncharacteristically quiet and reserved. They will feel depressed and stew on ways they have failed. They may notice minor bodily changes and become convinced that they are suffering from some life-threatening disease. They often become hypochondriacs, imagining all kinds of ailments that are befalling them physically.

How to help an ENTP experiencing stress:

– Give them time alone to deal with their feelings
– Avoid patronizing them, even if they are being irrational
– Don’t try to “solve the problem”
– Listen without making judgments, or trying to talk them out of their negative state
– Encourage them to have some time alone to exercise
– Encourage them to get enough rest
– Give them a massage
– After they’ve calmed down a little, ask if they want help

## Health and Weight Loss Tips for Every Myers-Briggs® Personality Type

### The Ideal ENTP Diet Plan

ENTPs are visionary, innovative, creative individuals who like to be healthy but hate to be stuck on a strict, regimented plan that takes up a lot of thought and time. They like to be flexible, spontaneous, and mentally alert. As big-picture, future-oriented individuals they are focused on staying healthy so that they can be mentally alert and physically limber no matter what age they are. As I spoke to ENTPs I didn’t find that they went for diet plans or paid memberships. They were more likely to stick to basic rules like lower carbs, no sugar, and high protein. Many of them tracked their calories on My Fitness Pal so that they could ensure they weren’t eating more than they should.

“Dieting isn’t as complex as everyone makes it out to be. I track what I eat on My Fitness Pal and I keep my body and mind active. I don’t think about overeating when I’m excited about something. I don’t need to spend a bunch of money for rip-off diet programs and subscription services that will tell me stuff I already know and limit how much fun I can have with my food!” – Kathryn, an ENTP

Diet Tips for ENTPs:

– Since you thrive on being flexible and spontaneous, try to keep healthy snacks around so that you won’t binge on unhealthy snacks or fast food when you’re hungry. Almonds are a great choice because they’re packed with healthy nutrients and they help you to feel full longer.
– Don’t skip breakfast! Aim to eat a high-protein breakfast and smaller meals throughout the rest of the day.
– Cook once, eat all week. Make a giant batch of your favorite healthy food on the weekend and then package it in work-ready containers so that you don’t have to worry if you don’t have a healthy option to take to work. A lot of times people eat fast foods during their lunch breaks because they didn’t have the time to make a healthy meal. Getting it all cooked in one go and then having your meals ready for the week will help you stay on track.
– As an ENTP you want to keep your brain alert and active. Check out this list of 15 brain foods that boost attention and focus.
– Try to drink at least eight 8-oz. glasses of water a day. Drinking water reduces your risk of developing colon or bladder cancer, helps you to be more alert and optimistic, increases athletic performance, suppresses the appetite, and flushes out waste and bacteria.
– Download My Fitness Pal to have a quick and easy way to track your food intake, no matter where you are! If you are the type to go out to eat a lot you can usually enter a restaurant name into their search and find out the calories and nutrition information for their meals.
– Keep your gym bag packed and in your car so that you’re up for spontaneous trips to the gym, hiking trails, or whatever adventure awaits you!


## How Each Myers-Briggs® Type Can Feel Lonely (and What To Do About It!)

https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/10/05/myers-briggs-type-can-feel-lonely/

### The ENTP and Loneliness

ENTPs are creative, innovative, and intensely logical individuals. They enjoy intellectual sparring with just about anyone and are fascinated by deep, theoretical discussions and possibilities. They tend to be humorous, energetic, and easy to get along with. At the same time, they can easily lose friends because many of them have a penchant for arguing and debate. This can quickly turn off some types and cause friendships to fizzle out over time. This can be frustrating for ENTPs as usually their argumentative-nature isn’t mean-spirited but just a combination of their desire for truth (Ti) and simultaneous desire to see multiple perspectives (Ne). They can feel lonely if they are surrounded by people but have no one with whom they can share  deep, fascinating ideas. They tend to have a natural charm and easy sociability that draws people in, but getting past the “acquaintance” phase of a friendship can be a struggle. They also may be irritated by people who focus extensively on day-to-day concerns without respect for the big picture, or people who value feelings over logic to an extreme degree.

Loneliness Hacks for ENTPs:

– Join an online debate community like debate.org where you can argue philosophy, politics, and religion without shame.
– Try going somewhere you’ve never been and talking to people from different cultures. Perhaps your current environment isn’t conducive to the friendships you need.
– Get outside and exercise to refresh your mind and body.
– Have a friend or family member you can trust? Invite them over for a game or coffee or just talk on the phone.
– Find a meetup group or book club that revolves around one of your interests.
– Find a volunteer opportunity that coincides with a passion of yours. This is a great way to be inspired and find like-minded friends.

## The Weak Spot of Every Myers-Briggs® Personality Type (and How to Strengthen It!)

https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/10/20/weak-spot-every-myers-briggs-personality-type-strengthen/

### The Extraverted Intuitive Personality Types: ENTPs and ENFPs

ENTPs and ENFPs have inferior Introverted Sensing (Si). As a result, they tend to favor new possibilities and theoretical innovations over “tried and true” methods or routines. They can become so focused on the future and what “could” happen that they forget to notice what they need now. This can result in them forgetting to eat, forgetting to sleep enough, or missing current details that are important. Where sensors are at risk of not seeing the forest for the trees, intuitives are at a risk of not seeing the trees for the forest. ENPs who work on developing Si can be more aware, more physically healthy, and better able to pay attention to details that are important for their daily life. All types tend to develop their inferior function in later life, but there’s no reason you can’t start earlier than that!

It’s important to remember that you should only practice these techniques in times of low stress. If you are stressed, focusing on your inferior function can only make you feel more anxious and stressed.

Ways to Develop Introverted Sensing:

– Take a moment to reflect on how you feel in detail right now. How do you feel physically? Are you tense anywhere or relaxed? Are you hungry or tired? How do you feel emotionally? Are you stressed, happy, sad? Take moments throughout the day to check in with yourself and really understand what’s going on inside your body and mind.
– Next time your brainstorming, see how many solutions you can find that have been successful in the past.
– Think of a favorite memory. Where were you? What did you feel like? Were there any sights, sounds, or smells you can recall? Close your eyes and try to immerse yourself in that memory.
– Tell a story in a sequential order. Start at the beginning and make sure you don’t bounce around in time.
– Remember exactly what you did that made someone happy before. Do that same thing again.
– Take up a hobby like knitting, crocheting, or cross stitch. Pay attention to how the repetition involved can make you feel relaxed.
– Think about your daily routine (if you have one). Is there anything you could do to add more consistency to your routine and therefore less stress?
– Smell a piece of fruit or a flower or a perfume. What exactly does the smell remind you of?  What do you experience or think of?
