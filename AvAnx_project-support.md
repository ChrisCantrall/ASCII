When I go dead to something, it stops being part of my life. 
- When I go dead to an area of my apartment, it stops being part of my life, but it's still part of my home. 
- When I go dead to an area of my job, it stops being part of my life, but it's still part of my commitments.

Meta-Anxiety : Decide to try something again, and while still working at it, "knowing" that I'll fail again, ANXIOUSLY waiting for me to fail.

Don't know what I want. Maybe because ... explore that. Related to anxiety? Anxious about things I want, so I avoid wanting things?
