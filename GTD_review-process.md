The first and most important thing about the weekly review is that it is an unbreakable date with yourself â€“ it takes priority over all things. (How put that into practice?)

1. Get Clear
2. Get Current
3. Get Creative

Use OmniOutliner (Taskpaper in Editorial?) for the Review Checklist, OmniFocus to prepare for the Large Time spent with review checklist. (OF to gather paper at work, OO to review at home.)

Weekly review Thursday night, weekly preview Sunday night. 

# GTD horizons & reviews

Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly reviews - each looking at the Horizons around that time frame. Use the trigger lists in GTD & MIAW, the various Boeing tools (PE, BG&Os, 63Y xls) to ensure that everything is captured & clarified. 

Quarterly review is a day after a Weekly review.
Yearly review is a week after a quarterly review, and the day after a weekly review. (Everything below that review is known to be clean, clear, and creatively considered.)

# Priorities

An organizational priority has

1. A budget.
2. A schedule.
3. An owner.

So - what are the equivalents for a personal priority? A calendar-based plan? Accountability with someone else?

When I'm tired and grumpy, I see some things more clearly than when I'm energetic and expansive. That's the time to trim the to do list. - John D. Cook
