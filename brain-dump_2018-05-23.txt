- My heart is lonely.
- Stewardship means 
	- Investing - like in a home or condo.
	- Maintaining - like regular car maintenance.
	- Maintaining - like regular exercise and healthy living.
- What kind of Example Christian am I at work?
- Sinning in my eyes & heart hurts.
- Courage is the form of every virtue when it matters.
	- Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point.
	- Courage is a prerequisite for the practice of all other virtues otherwise one is virtuous only when virtue has no cost.
	- How to practice courage?
- AvAnx
	- I am anxious. My mind and body are tense & nervous. 
	- I am avoiding. A lot. 
- I need a flexible schedule / pattern that suggests things to do at appropriate intervals to maintain momentum on projects, and reduce total maintenance effort by keeping up with maintenance. (Clean bathroom every other week; even that is a bit much.) Like Management Monday and Filing Friday.
	- Need record of when I've done ManMon, and when I've skipped, so guidelines like "Don't skip it twice in a row" are useful. (Not a record of what was done, just a trinary switch : Done, Not Done, No Record Created.) For Example : Script / Action updates _something_ with the recent performance history - ☑︎☒︎□︎ is Done, Not Done, No Data.
