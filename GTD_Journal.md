The Weekly Confrontation is aptly named. Yuck. It's tough to confront how I'm failing to keep the promises I made myself. And others. But it's the only way I'll actually do what I want to do - and what I need to do but don't want to do. 

That, and the DO part of Collect, Process, Organize, Review, Do.

Any physical space that remains the same long enough - you will become dead to. For me this means that even if I've already created a place for something if that place has changed or become overgrown then it's not the same place and I have to be reevaluate it. For example my desk is the same place it has always been for working but it has become overgrown on the left side with stuff and I've become dead to it. Therefore I need to have some way to continually reevaluate background areas - look at the desk with a new light, Change the Alpha waves to beta waves.

Every single thing in my life is judged against these two priorities. 
1) Get healthy so I can live a full, long & complete life in Christ.
2) Draw near to God.

Monthly review at home.
I'm avoiding a bunch of 30k Goals & Objectives and several 20k Areas of Focus. And I think I'm going to continue to put them on hold, but be non-avoidant about it, flatly & clearly state that I'm not doing them for a while. Instead, I'm going to focus on health.
