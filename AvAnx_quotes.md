Physical pain reminds you you're alive, but mental pain tests your will to stay that way. - Jacob Schick USMC; 22kill.com


The Cure for Anxiety
25 ﻿“For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
26 “Look at the birds of the ﻿air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?
27 “And who of you by being worried can add a single ﻿hour to his ﻿life?
28 “And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin,
29 yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.
30 “But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith!
31 “Do not worry then, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing?’
32 “For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
33 “But ﻿seek first ﻿His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be ﻿added to you.
34 ﻿“So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will ﻿care for itself. ﻿Each day has enough trouble of its own.
