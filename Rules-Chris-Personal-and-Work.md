Character is the (sum|product ... PRODUCT ) of each choice made on each day. 
You can always do better. And worse.


01. Be truthful with those you care for, and with those you respect. 
02. "Feeling fine" when you've been home sick for days is a far cry from being ready to work well for 10 hours. 
03. When someone of demonstrated skill makes a mistake, kindly show them the mistake, and then do not mention it again. Hovering or obvious watching only makes them nervous, and they make more mistakes. Quietly observe them, inconspicuously - praise any job done well, and be ready to correct them gently if they stumble again.


00. Care.

Sometimes the windmill loses. (Ralph S. Jackson III)

Wish for a unicorn as much as you want. But when wishing for a pony, have a stable & some feed ready. Just in case. (Murdering the statement of Ralph S. Jackson III)

When wishing for a pony, have a stable & some feed ready. Just in case. (paraphrase of Ralph S. Jackson III)


Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up. Never give in. - The Doctors' promise, The Day of the Doctor.

THOUGHTS AND IDEAS

John D. Cook: Boredem is the curse of the Competant.


simple rules must meet four conditions: They must be limited in number, tailored to the person or organization using them, applied to well-defined activities, and open to giving people latitude to exercise discretion.

The authors identify two types of simple rules: Those that can help you make decisions and those that can help you do things.

The authors say the simple rules can be applied to work and personal challenges through a three-step process:

Define what you want to do
Choose a bottleneck
Craft the rules

There's a difference between writing it down and writing it up.
