2 - When you are at your travel destination, always assume that you will never be back, and try to do everything that you want to do, right when you want to do it. I don’t know how many times I have been in some foreign country, and thought, “Hey, that looks interesting! I’ll come back this way tomorrow and check it out,” only to simply never get back to it. Act on your impulses, so that you don’t bring home regrets.

6 - You are far more apt to leave something behind if you are comfortable in a location. Take your packing list with you in order to make sure you return with everything you brought.

21 - Over time, work out what you need on any given kind of trip. That saves making a packing list each time. Whether it is business, camping, visiting family, you can semi-automate your packing which eliminates waste on the way out and reduces attrition through forgetfulness on the way back.
If in doubt, run through your routines for things like a washbag e.g. “Get up, brush teeth (toothbrush and paste), shower and shave (soap, shampoo, razor, brush?), brush hair (hairbrush), deodorant (can or whatever).” Add in regular daily or weekly needs (medicines, nail clippers, etc.) and you can be almost sure that – barring unusual circumstances or emergencies – you are well covered.

33 - Black bags are more likely to be opened at the airport / customs / border crossing, so don’t carry a black bag chose some friendlier color !

37 - "Folders" from Eagle Creek. Great for packing shirts never seem to arrive un-wrinkled if I roll them.

39 - I’ve been carrying a Versipack (from a company called Maxpedition) around for about three months now. {concealed carry bag}

47 - My packing tip, at least with regards to not losing checked baggage:
Pack a firearm, or starter pistol in your checked bag. The FAA requires that all “firearms” be declared at the checkin counter, and a special bit is assigned to your bags, and they will be watched very closely. I ended up at a different airport once on my way back home due to weather, and when I arrived at the airport where my bags were, there was an airport police officer in the baggage claim area, hovering near my bag.
(hint: the starter pistols are only firearms according to the FAA. They don’t fall under any other Federal or local definitions of firearms, so only needed to be handled carefully on the planes, and no registration is required.)

50 - Always have a way to keep your money out of the reach of pick-pocketers. I have a satch that goes around my neck that works great.

66 - My tip is to have a standard set of “travel size toiletries” in a seperate doop bag. When you need to travel all you need to do is get the bag and not hunt around the morning of your flight for mouthwash, toothpaste, gel, etc. It really saves a ton of time.

67 - As a tip for those who are traveling, when you check your bag, try to do something to make it easily identifyable. The usual method for doing this is tying a bright colored ribbon or hankerchief on it, but that always looks tacky, not manly. Instead I wrap the handles in twine. This increases both the manliness and the ease with which the bag can be identified, not to mention giving me a chance to try new knots and improving the grip on my luggage.

78 - Get off the beaten, tourist path when buying replacements at a destination. Even the highest-markup drugstore is going to be priced better than hotel shops.

79 - ...if you have a packing scheme (socks go here, pants there), you’ll save yourself the hassle of trying to find something needed in the dark at last minute. Plus, it’ll be the difference between a bag that’s easy to carry and a bag that is badly balanced.

81 - 
1. Carry a maglite in your bag. ... Just remember to change the battery every year or so that way you don’t end up stuck with a dead flashlight. If you don’t use it much, just rotate it with something else you have (I move the old batteries into my wireless keyboard) so you don’t waste them.

2. When I travel, I hate the idea that if something happens, my electronic data could be in peril. As a result I backup key stuff to a MicroSD card. They are so small they fit easily in a nook of your wallet and weight virtually nothing. You can get several GB’s of data in something smaller and lighter than your finger nail. Should you need to retrieve data, you can carry a USB reader in your bag, or in an emergency just buy one on the road, they aren’t that expensive. Easy way to always have key data at your fingertips. If you have a cell phone that lets you save files to it (or it’s memory card) that’s another great alternative, just keep in mind it’s more likely to be searched at US customs and border security. {don't use compact flash, I've got many large SD cards}

3. If flying with other family members, cross-pack. Rather than 1 person to 1 bag, mix it up. That way if one bag doesn’t show up at your destination, someone isn’t missing everything. Odds of loosing all your bags are pretty small. This just reduces your chances of problems. 

84 - When I am traveling for business I never check any bags. To save space and avoid problems when going through security, I do not pack any liquids.
When I arrive at my hotel I either go to the store in the lobby or a near by drug store and purchase travel size shaving cream, tooth paste, disposable razors and some kind of gel for my hair. I also buy travel shampoo and conditioner if the hotel does not provide these.
These travel size products are inexpensive enough to be disposed of upon check out and I don’t have to worry about having the proper size zip lock bag with me and I do not have to worry about anything leaking into my bathroom kit while on the plane. 

100 - My bag packing tip is to pack a deck of cards in the bags.

106 - All the great tips are taken, but I do have a product recommendation that has made my travel packing easier:
Lands End no-iron tailored fit pinpoint oxfords.
I was out to dinner with a group of female associates and the clean and pressed appearance my shirt drew several nice comments. I didn’t tell them that it was the third day I’d worn that shirt because I got caught in the rain with the other shirt I brought on the trip.
Also I will make a plug for Dungham’s oxford shoes. They hold a shine and are great for a long sprint to a connecting flight. 

155 - Retired Army. KISS.
Use your packing list every time you pack.
Pack layers of clothing for any anticipated weather or social situation.
Roll your clothes.
Be kind to your fellow travellers, especially children and older people.

170 - Packing tip: set up your “every-day carry” stuff in an intelligent and useful manner – for your man bag you’ll need pens, pencils, keys, something to write on, and then any personal electronics or work/hobby stuff you always need with you; when you know what you need, organize it in small accessible pouches neatly arranged inside the man-bag to leave room for incidental stuff that you put in and take out as need be. Your every day carry stuff stays organized and doesn’t get jumbled up inside the bag, and you can always find what you need without having to dig through it all. A man-bag is *not* a purse – it shouldn’t be a rat’s-nest of crap you have to dump out to find anything.

174 - never – EVER – forget the duct tape!
don’t fold, roll.

228 - When preparing for my first transatlantic flight to London, a seasoned traveler shared this impressive tip with me. He said, “If think you will need more room in suitcase for the return trip home, pack the underwear, socks and undershirts that you can part with after one more wear. Throw them away after you wear them. That way you will have that much room in your bag for items that you purchase while on vacation. The trick is packing exactly the number of changes you will need while abroad.”
It seemed like great advice. I carefully counted out how much I would need and went on my way. However, during the trip my return flight was canceled and my vacation was extended for a day. Among the many souvenirs I brought home was a pair of really expensive underwear.

235 - 4. Always pack a towel. Enough said. Just do it, it’ll save you in the end.

238 - I find that socks can make or break a lot of trips, especially outdoor trips where you may be exposed to the elements. There is nothing worse than being stuck in a pair of stinky, wet socks that squelch in your boots with every step, aside from maybe putting on a pair of stinky, still-wet socks from the day before.
I always over-pack socks, typically 1 or 2 extra pairs, plus a pair of big wool ones for sleeping in if I’m outdoors. Plus you can stuff them into a sweater or compression sack and use them for a pillow if you forget your own.

245 - If you ever make it out to the far east be sure to bring immodium. It might save you a bloody mess! literally!

246 - By packing some nearly-worn-out clothing, you can throw it away at your travel locale and replace it’s space in your luggage with souvenirs and stuff. This also has the bonus effect of helping you keep your wardrobe healthy and fresh. 

263 - When you visit a new city, especially a crowded tourist-filled destination, rise before dawn and visit one of the famous landmarks while the sun is new. I know this sounds like a crazy way to beat the crowds, but the morning stillness and light will give you a whole different perspective on the landmark you’re visiting. Try it and you’ll be hooked!

266 - General packing tip – always take a swimsuit. It doesn’t much matter where you are going or for how long. Just trust me.
269 - Roll and Bag all of your clothes. By rolling all of my clothes you can easily decrease the amount of space you need to carry everything. A plus with rolling is that nothing wrinkles either. The other thing I have learned is to bag all of my clothes, not just toiletries. In case something breaks or water gets into the bag. This has saved me quite a few times. It is not that much to go out and buy a few dozen Ziploc bags and just keep them with your packing stuff.
...
Having a to-go bag pre-stocked is something I learned just from reading the comments.

270 - 
2. Always have at least one decent-looking shirt with you, should a situation arise where you need to dress up just a bit.
3. Bring less pants than you think you’ll need. Pants are cumbersome, and you’ll likely find your favorite pair and wear them all the time anyway.

279 - 4- Be Prepared- I am an Eagle Scout and believe fully in the Boy Scout motto!
my VERY unmanly overnight bag contains several items that never leave it so that no matter what i will be prepared. 1 small first aid kid which only contains the basics, but its handy in a pinch. 1 Red handkerchief, 1 rock solid lock back buck knife. 1 cell phone battery. 1 cell phone charger. 1 bottle of water. 1 small 3×4 notepad, 1 permanent marker, 1 pencil, 1 pen, 1 disposable lighter, 1 black plasic garbage bag, 50 dollars in 5’s and ones. ( you can usually make change from strangers anywhere you go should you need it) enough for a quick cab ride and some food and water. all of this is usually rolled up in the handkerchief and left in one pocket of my overnight bag. its my “emergency kit” of sorts and has saved my a** on more than on ocassion!

284 - After having one of our employees incapacitated in a car accident and all of his identification stolen at the scene, all personnel traveling to less than friendly countries were advised to write their emergency contact information in permanent marker on their upper thigh. I can see the wisdom to doing this on personal travel, too.

289 - Essentials are all you need:
Dr Bronnners’ liquid Peppermint soap. good for hair, skin, teeth, laundry and contraception (if you believe the bottle)
Safety Razor and Toothbrush.
Merino Wool underwear: hot or cold, this stuff has you covered, will not stink if you don’t wash it, will dry overnight if you do
Stout boots.
Comfortable yet well made clothes.
A bag, a book and whatever electrickery your trip requires.
A polite and humble demeanour. (not packable, must be worn)

303 - My travel tip applies both abroad and at home: Every time you wonder about what to do, ask yourself: “What can I do that I couldn’t normally do?”

307 - I don’t like to go anywhere without having the following items handy:
pocket notebook
pistol
digital camera
lighter
magnifying glass
checkbook
leatherman tool
flashlight
pocket calculator
medicine box
and because of the nature of my work I carry the following with me:
My bills & pending correspondence
computer memory chips
hobo knife
tape measure

308 - Bring a camera. Always.

309 - I don’t go anywhere without the following items. If I’m traveling, they are in my bag, and in day to day life, I’ve got them in my car. They have saved me from countless embarrassing situations.
Tide pen – greatest cleaning product of the last 10 years
Sewing kit – The cheap, drugstore kind with a few colors of thread and a couple extra buttons. Worth its weight in plutonium.
Other items I usually have with me:
Extra socks – stepping in a puddle at 10AM is a great way to be uncomfortable all day
The chargers to any gadget I’ve got on me – Even if I’m not planning on being gone long enough to use them.


Playing cards – Stuck in a group for a couple hours with nothing to do? Instantly become a hero by pulling these out.

310 - I read about the military having first, second, and third “line” gear. Third line is all the stuff they can leave at base. Second line is stuff that makes life nice when traveling and humping about the wilderness or whatever they do. First line is the essentials – gun, knife, food, water, ammo. I like to think that a manbag should be the civilian’s first-line gear – everything important you need for the day should be in it.
The same thing applies to travelling. Bring your first-line gear with you on the plane, check everything else.

311 - Keep a red backpack in your closet with a spare toothbrush, travel sizes of your toiletries, a month’s supply of all your medications, and a light jacket. When you travel, throw the bag in your suitcase and you’re halfway done with your packing. It also keeps you prepared for a natural disaster.

320 - When traveling I always take along baby wipes. They come in handy to clean your hands, freshen up after a stuffy plane ride, they could even save the day if you end up in a stall without paper! You can get small baggy containers of wipes for about a dollar at places like walmart.

324 - I used to travel for a living so here are my tips:
1. Cut down on the heavy stuff. Don’t pack extra pants or coats. Pack two pairs of shoes (including what you wear to the airport). Three or more just takes too much room, and only having one pair leaves you vulnerable (a business trip or a vacation is NOT the time to break in a new pair of shoes).
2. Check the weather. I’m surprised at the number of times I met up with people who just guessed what the weather would be.
3. The time to stop the pack sparingly rule is for toiletries. Get a decent dopp bag or something like that, and keep it in your bathroom for at least a week and see what you normally use. Whatever you use, buy a spare and keep it in your kit. Don’t assume you will remember to pack it the morning of your trip. If you buy your spares ahead of time, you can get them for a decent price and won’t be running to 7-11 first thing in the morning at your destination. Also, get some small baggies and pack some extra tylenol, aspirin, advil, or whatever your pain killer of choice is. You probably won’t need more than a couple, but having them will prevent any unnecessary pain. Plus, pack a couple bandages, some medical tape, neosporin, tweezers, nail clippers, and q-tips. None of these things take up that much room, and again the alleviation factor is tremendous.
4. I’m of two minds about the wrinkle factor: all the decent hotels should have an iron, but sometimes a “decent” hotel in the middle of nowhere won’t. So call ahead. Since I crossed time zones a lot, I wasn’t a big fan of taking the time to iron at my destination (sleep was higher on my list), so I got a little travel container of downy wrinkle release (which won’t give you that crisp starchy look, but will take out wrinkles from shirts and pants).

334 - Learn how to travel with only a carry-on. It’s not just a question of being more flexible and mobile. The learning process forces you to reevaluate what’s really necessary to take with you through life.

346 - Pack light on departure; nothing fits as well on the return, particularly if you bring home gifts for the kiddos.

347 - I travel bt air at least 20 times per year and spend about 75 nights per year away from home. Packing quickly is a necessity, afterall, if I spent an hour getting ready for each trip I would lose an addtional day out of my life!
Here you go:
1 – for trips of just a couple of days forget about a Dopp kit. Keep all the essentials in a clear ziplock bag ready to go. I hav eerything ready and in the op drawer. When I reurn from a trip I replace what I need and put the whole bag away.
2 – even on an overnight carry one more of everything than you think. You are already taking a carry-on so use it. People tell you to travel light but an extra shirt and change of under clothes won’t kill you. You never know what you wll spill, st on or rub against. Who wants to see a customer in dirty clothes? Ever been stuck overnight unexpectedly without a fresh change of clothes? makes a world of difference.
3 – Put the airline customer service number in your phone. When the flight is delayed or canceled you have he phoe number while everyone else is running to the customer servce desk to change flights. You’re already booked while they are waiting in line and complaining to each other!
4 – If you travel with a computer bring a movie. No kidding. I love to read and bring plenty of books, magaznes, etc. But if you are stuck at an airport for hors and then have a long flight you can only read so much. If ou ravel frequently you have seen every movie and show the airlines have to offer. I try to stop and rent one on my way to the airport.
5 – This will sound paranoid…but. When we take off or land I always put my wallet and my cell phone in my pocket. I have never had to exit a plane in an emergency but you ever know. If those items are in your bag they will be left behind but if they are in my pocket I can make the necessary calls home and arrangements wherever I may be.

349 - I travel quite a bit for my job. I found it best to buy extra toiletries (deoderant, razor, brush, etc.) for my shaving kit instead of just using what I have at home. All I have to do is grab my kit and I’m ready without worrying if I have everything.
Another packing tip – I never check bagage. I always carry on. I have a bag that meets all criteria for size for carry-on. I always pack items in the same place and in the same sequence. For example, dress pants go in first on the right side as I pack with dress shirts on top. Running gear goes on the left side. Socks pack in around the shoes. T-shirts and underwear on top. Shaving kit goes in the middle between the stacks of clothes.
Everything has its place and there is a place for everything. It makes packing much more simple and you don’t worry if you forgot anything.

357 - Absolutely never put your car keys in your checked luggage. My cousin did this and ended up having to spend the night in the airport when the airline lost his luggage on his return flight.

378 - For those trips when I’m going to be essentially living out of my bag, I roll one t-shirt with one pair of underwear in each roll. That way all I have to do is reach into my bag, grab a roll, and head to the shower. ... For those things that I used to use rubber bands, I now use heavy-duty hair bands. They are cheap, much more durable than rubber bands, and come in a variety of colors. ... If I’m going to be someplace where I’ll need a clothesline (or have other need for rope), I take a bit of U.S. military paracord (also known as 550 cord). It’s thin, light, and has a 550 lb. tensile strength, so it’s incredibly versatile.

381 - Keep enough cash to hire a cab in a separate pocket from your wallet so that you won’t be stranded and helpless if you get pickpocketed.

402 - I recommend packing a few cliff bars or something similar. You never know if your flight will be delayed or friend will be late to pick you up or you get trapped in a snowstorm. It’s always a good idea to have a back up food source.

410 - My travel tip, after being a consultant for several years, is to carry things that are interchangeable. You can get by, and look good, by carrying the right clothes in a smaller suit case. There’s no need to pack for every situation when you can travel with less and still be prepared.
1. The essential bathroom items, e.g. toothbrush, tooth paste, razor, shaving cream, shampoo (small bottle), soap (small bottle).
2. A good pair of jeans
3. Two pairs of slacks in different colors
4. A Navy or patterned sport coat
5. Three shirts of different colors that go well with your sport coat
6. Travel in a pair of comfortable sneakers and pack a pair of dress shoes
Bingo, you’re prepared for anything.

419 - Most guys know the best way to pack slacks is to fold them in half and then roll them up. But you have to remember to take them out of your suitcase and hang them up as soon as you check in to your hotel. Rolling isn’t perfect and an overnight hang will get rid of any wrinkles. Especially if you use the hangars with the clips and let the full length of the slacks hang down. The weight of the pants helps get rid of any wrinkles.
But what about your sport jacket? My first boss (who was a lieutenant in the Marine Reserves) taught me this trick and it works: hold the jacket up with each hand on a shoulder and tuck the right shoulder into the left armhole. Then fold it half and pack it away. Give it a try!

422 - My favorite travel tip from my days fresh out of high school is to ALWAYS keep bail money with you.

428 - George Carlin did a great comedy piece on stuff that explains the necessity to have a bag, or a number of bags to carry your stuff.

429 - Couple of things that make my travel life easy. Set up your toiletries kit for easy packing – keep it packed with everything you need to travel with, there is no reason you can’t have two of everything (one for home and one for travel). That way you grab your kit and go, also make sure you have some ziploc bags for air travel.
I also have been working on investing in high-quality goods for my travel needs. Good bags, a travel portfolio with all my relevant travel items (hotel membership cars, passport, etc).

Also, good travel tips for traveling light at the following: http://www.onebag.com/

447 - Whenever I am on the road and I’m checking luggage or driving, I pack a multi-tool or kitchen tool combo that includes a corkscrew, a can opener, bottle opener, and a sharp knife. This helps me save on food expenses, because I can go to a local grocer and purchase fresh fruit, cheese, canned/bottled beverages, and other foods without worrying about how I’m going to crack them open back in hotel room.

461 - I have two tips to share that are both indispensable for my daily life:
1. Keep an empty briefcase that has no other purpose but to shuttle items between the office and home. Make a designated spot for it both at home and work, and whenever you come across something that needs to go from one to the other, put it in the bag. Be diligent about emptying it at each place daily, and don’t let it collect anything.

2. Keep a light overnight bag packed with the basics at all times. Invest in duplicates of all your toiletries and keep them in your dopkit in the bag. Put an extra phone charger in the bag. Add a small digital clock. I even go so far as to add some t-shirts and underwear. Next time you have to go on a short trip, you only have to add the specifics for that trip, you won’t have forgotten some small item, and the packing will be stress-free. When you return, simply remove your laundry and put the whole bag away, ready for the next trip.

473 - No question about it – these bags are manly. Its sad when you see someone show up to a meeting impeccably dressed in a nice suit and the whole nine yards, only to ruin the whole image by toting a ratty backpack along with them.
Travel Tip #2: When traveling internationally, pack a healthy supply of food with you to save money and to be prepared for the unexpected. The extra room in the bag on the way back can then be used for souveniers.

475 - Although this is probably rare and pretty specific, it is something I learned the hard way: never check a large battery in a Rubbermaid tub on an international flight. Those tubs aren’t as durable up there as they seem down here and there is a good possibility that battery acid will end up all over everyone’s luggage.

491 - Travel tip: always, always no matter where you are traveling, no matter the time of year, no matter if you are male or female, always carry a bathing suit.

525 - I think some of the most valuable travel advice I have, I learned in China. Don’t assume every funny item on a translated menu is a typo. Sometimes, Ice Clam with Fruit really is just that.

542 - My best travel tip is to travel in nice clothes. Some nice pans, a button-up shirt and a sports coat is fine. The reson for this is even if your luggage gets lost, you’re still presentable for any meetings or conferences you plan to attend.

560 - One I didn’t see while scanning was what to do if you’re traveling economy and don’t have an iron in the room to de-wrinkle clothes. Get a small spray bottle, fill it with water and lightly spray your clothes before hanging them in the bathroom to steam with hot shower water. Works every time. 

584 - have a briefcase that has my business related stuff.
I have a “BOB” acronym for Bug out Bag.
This bag is for, to put it bluntly, to bug out. It contains several area maps, first aid kit, small axe, wire saw, one man tent, matches, several knives of various sizes, compass, flint, rescue blanket, rope,chemical water purifier,snake bite kit, thread, needles and just about everything I feel I might need if I needed to survive for a few days without any other modern conveniences.
The idea is not to hide out after committing a crime or anything, but in the absolutely rare instance that society comes unraveled, or a national emergency creates a situation where we are temporarily unable to enjoy or current luxuries.
I vehicle breakdown on a long drive (in the middle of no where) I live in a very rural area and the things I pack are related to the things I might encounter.
Those in urban areas may choose other things. Is it paranoia? Maybe just a little. But I see it almost the same as insurance. You pay a monthly stipend to the insurance company for just in case. I choose to have me a small bag of just in case.

654 - My fav advice is make sure you saren wrap Shampoo lotion and tooth paste.

707 - I keep a 15′ piece of paracord and some clothespins in my bag so that clothes can be washed in a sink and then dried in my room using the makes-hift clothesline.

717 - I keep plastic drawers in our closet that have all travel supplies from little toiletries to travel iron, to ear phones etc so I just go through these as I pack.

720 -My best tip is like many have said is be prepared. After litteraly 100 trips without incident I had the worst trip ever, what could go wrong did. Be sure to always pack you medicines with you, I always would just throw it in my suitcase afraid some airline clerk would hassle me. Turns out better to deal with the small hassle then fill a prescription out of town

724 - Third tip — I write my itinerary, as well as my home address, on the luggage tag for the outbound trip. That way, if the bag does get lost somewhere along the way, I can be found at any leg of my journey.

732 - 1) Travel sizes of everything!
2) Synthetic (fast dry) towel in a baggie.
3) Keep your dopp packed and ready to go at all times….when you get back from a trip, refill and reorganize the next day. Nothing cooler than taking 3 minutes to pack for a weekend.

4) put a hand towel in an outside pocket…being able to wipe sweat or dry your hands in an airport is important.

Everything after "****####****####" was fiddled with before the Proper Re-Work, but it might have a few good notes.
