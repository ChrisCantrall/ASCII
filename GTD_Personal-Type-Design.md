Type Design for Chris Cantrall

Defines What exists and Why it exists. What: habit of reading Bible daily; Why: listen to God every day, you are what you eat.

* Define my lifestyle, not just the milestones, but the everyday experience. Read a book a week? Every month? Play music? Write music? Go to concerts / Doctor Funk? Paint? Write fiction? Write history? Shoot?

* Complete list of commitments. This includes what I am partially committed to. If it's any kind of commitment, make it a project in OF - everything else is in Someday Maybe.

# GOAL
Don't pull a Mac Sparky, never have to say "I made a decision without consciously considering it".

Source of the Goal:

> It occurred to me that, unknowingly, that fateful day where I’d have to make some tough decisions had arrived and I had been too busy to notice. Put simply, the big case needed me and I pushed aside MacSparky and my own clients without thinking of it. The realization that **I’d made a decision without actually considering it** upset me. How did I let myself fall into this trap that I’d merely deferred on what is one of the most important decisions of my life?
