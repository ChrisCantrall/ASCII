(OUTCOME: All my open loops are fully identified, clarified, assessed, and actionalized. I need to assess my life and work at the appropriate horizons, making the appropriate decisions, at the appropriate intervals, in order to really come clean.)

# MAKING IT ALL WORK

## Appendix iv - Mastering Work Flow

1. Collect
• Capture anything and everything that has your attention in leakproof external “buckets” (your in-baskets, e-mail, notebooks, voice mail, etc.). Get them out of your short-term memory (use the Incompletion Trigger Lists to keep yourself “downloaded”).
• Have as few of these collectors as you can and as many as you need.
• Empty them regularly, by processing and organizing (see below).
2. Process
• Process the items you have collected (decide what each thing means, specifically).
• If it is not actionable, toss it, “tickle” it for possible later action, or file it as reference.
• If it is actionable, decide the very next physical action: do it (if less than two minutes); delegate it (and track it on a “waiting for” list), or defer it (put it on an action-reminder list or in an action folder). If one action will not close the loop, then identify the commitment as a project and put it on a reminder list of projects. 
3. Organize
• Group the results of processing your input into appropriately retrievable and reviewable categories. The four key action categories are: Projects (projects you have a commitment to finish) Calendar (actions that must occur on a specific day or at a specific time) Next Actions (actions to be done as soon as possible) Waiting For (projects and actions others are supposed to be doing and which you care about)
• Add subcategories of these lists if it makes them easier to use (Calls, Errands, At Home, At Computer, etc.).
• Add lists of longer-horizon goals and values that influence you.
• Add checklists that may be useful as needed (job description, event-trigger lists, org charts, etc.).
• Maintain a general-reference filing system for information and materials that have no action but which may need to be retrieved.
• Maintain an “on-hold” system for triggers of possible actions at later dates (Someday/Maybe lists, calendar, tickler).
• Maintain support information files for projects as needed (can be kept in reference system or in pending area). 
4. Review
• Review calendar and action lists daily (or whenever you could possibly do any of them).
• Conduct a customized weekly review to get clean, get current, and get creative (see Weekly Review).
• Review the longer-horizon lists of goals, values, and visions as often as required to keep your project list complete and current. 
5. Do
• Make choices about your actions based on what you can do (context), how much time you have, how much energy you have, and then your priorities.
• Stay flexible by maintaining a “total life” action reminder system, always accessible for review, trusting your intuition in moment-to-moment decision-making.
• Choose to: 1- do work you have previously defined or 2- do ad hoc work as it appears or 3- take time to define your work (You must sufficiently process and organize to trust your evaluation of the priority of the ad hoc.)
• Ensure the best intuitive choices by consistent regular focus on priorities. (“What is the value to me of doing X instead of doing Y?”) Revisit and recalibrate your commitments at appropriate intervals for the various levels of life and work (see Horizons of Focus):
• Runway - current actions (daily)
• 10,000 ft. - current projects (weekly)
• 20,000 ft. - current responsibilities (monthly)
• 30,000 ft. - 1-2 year goals (quarterly)
• 40,000 ft. - 3-5 year goals (annually)
• 50,000 ft. - career, purpose, lifestyle (annually +)


## Appendix v - The Weekly Review 

GET CLEAR
Collect Loose Papers and Materials 
Gather all accumulated business cards, receipts, and miscellaneous paper-based materials into your in-basket. 
Get “IN” to zero
Process completely all outstanding paper materials, journal and meeting notes, voice mails, dictation, and e-mails. 
Empty Your Head 
Put in writing and process any uncaptured new projects, action items, waiting-fors, someday/maybes, etc.   

GET CURRENT
Review Action Lists
Mark off completed actions. Review for reminders of further action steps to record. 
Review Previous Calendar Data 
Review past calendar in detail for remaining action items, reference data, etc., and transfer into the active system. 
Review Upcoming Calendar 
Review upcoming calendar events (long- and short-term). Capture actions triggered. 
Review Waiting-For List 
Record appropriate actions for any needed follow-up. Check off received ones. 
Review Project (and Larger Outcome) Lists 
Evaluate status of projects, goals, and outcomes one by one, ensuring at least one current action item on each. Browse through project plans, support material, and any other work-in-progress material to trigger new actions, completions, waiting-fors, etc. 
Review Any Relevant Checklists 
Use as a trigger for any new actions.   

GET CREATIVE
Review Someday/Maybe List 
Review for any projects which may now have become active and transfer to “Projects.” 
Delete items no longer of interest. 
Be Creative and Courageous 
Any new, wonderful, harebrained, creative, thought-provoking, risk-taking ideas to add into your system?
