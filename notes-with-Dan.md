Notes from the semi-recent past.

* I've known I'm primarily motivated by fear (and shame) since talking to Enrique in college. Fear is on the same axis as anger. Anger is an emotional reaction of going towards and changing something, and that is confrontation - the antidote for anxiety/avoidance. Fear - anger and avoidance - confrontation. When fear becomes unhinged from reality, it becomes severe anxiety. ... Let the anger happen, use it, confront what makes me angry. 
* February 2 : When I told the Bible study that I didn't know what my emotions are, Erik said that he knows that I experience Frustration.(FYI, Frustration is an expression of Anger.) I express that emotion about work often. *I need to NOT continuously burden my friends with my frustration.* I need to deal with my work anger. Which probably means confronting it.
* Talking about *Thinking Fast and Slow* (Daniel Kahneman), Merlin: It's not unusual for us to avoid questions - not only to avoid questions we don't have an answer to, but to avoid questions whose context we don't understand. This leads to all kinds of biases and thinking errors, to where we try to come up with a question we think we can answer. This can lead to straw man arguments, ... 
* All weekly schedules must include administrivia - grocery shopping, toilet, laundry, dishes, etc. 
* GTD at work: In an excel tab, track project status and milestones, delegations?. A separate Action tab, linked in my head by the weekly review just like the old fashioned paper GTD. "If you can't do GTD on paper, you can't do GTD." Eliminate Omnifocus from work completely, no reminders, no repeats. 
* March 14 : I confessed / apologized about Soteria to Nancy a long time ago. I need to pray, think, and wait. Do I actually feel guilty? What then?
* Tell Nancy that Christophe is crazy?
* Dad told me that Kate may never have a good job, and I could be providing for her in retirement. Which I should plan for. *That's a new motivation.*
* When I recognize that I'm avoiding something, I need to do some small thing to act on it As Soon As Possible. Clean the kitchen for 5 minutes, put something next to the door, something. Start the confrontation, nip the avoidance in the butt. 
* Confrontation increases the anxiety now, but reduces it later. Avoiding now reduces anxiety somewhat immediately, but cause much more anxiety later. 
* Faith is something God gives us when we need him, when we're needy toward him. How can I express neediness for / toward God?
* Everyone has faith in something. My faith is in myself. Some of my failings are easier to see than those of others, so it's easier to see that my faith is misplaced, and it's easy for my unconscious to recognize that and get anxious.

Apathy & worthlessness & hopelessness & deep dark pit - I've given up on life. Kate took keys to gun cabinet.
