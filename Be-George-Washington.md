# The Starting Point #

From <http://www.beinggeorgewashington.com/the-starting-point/>.

Below are some items pulled from the writings of Washington and Franklin (with additional items added by Glenn) that we've identified as key things to start with and focus on every day. Think of these as "baseline" items to have in your life that are in addition to those things you add as part of this challenge.

Many of these will seem daunting at first, but by adding them to your Monthly Tracker and concentrating on them each day they'll become more and more routine.

* Every action must be done with respect toward others around you.
* Show no delight in the misfortune of others, even though he be your enemy.
* If anyone comes to speak to you while you are sitting, stand, even though he will be your inferior.
* Be not hasty to believe flying reports to the disparagement of any.
* associate yourself with men of good quality.

* Let your conversation be without malice or envy.
* Speak not infurious words neither in jest or in earnest.
* Always stand when a lady enters your circle or stands before the table.
