I Went to a Donner Party

(To the tune of “I Went to a Garden Party”.)

Went to a Donner Party, had a lunch of my old friends
Got to talk about a TV show on a Podcast again

And it’s all right now, stuck in this crevasse
You see, you can’t fly a zeppelin into a snowy mountain pass

...

When I got to the Donner Party, they all knew my name
I’d been on every episode, and they start to sound the same

...

Well, it’s all right now, I may have bought the farm
Because I’m just a bit delirious, and I cannot feel my arm

...

In the not too distant future, next Sunday AD,
There was a guy named Joel not too different from you and me
He worked at Gizmodics Institute, just a regular face in a red jumpsuit
He did a good job cleaning up the space, but his bosses put him in his place

But it’s all right now, I think I got it wrong, 
You see, well, these are the lyrics to a very different song (La la la)

Garden Party
by
Rick Nelson

I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When i got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, i didn't look the same

[Chorus]

But it's all right now, i learned my lesson well.
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

People came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
'n' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in dylan's shoes wearing his disguise

[Chorus]

Lott-in-dah-dah-dah, lot-in-dah-dah-dah
Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said hello to "mary lou", she belongs to me
When i sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave

[Chorus]

Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah)
Lot-in-dah-dah-dah

Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped johnny b. goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, i wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all i sang, i rather drive a truck

[Chorus]

Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah)
Lot-in-dah-dah-dah

'n' it's all right now, learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself

So it began this way, I can't recall how it got started 
So it began this way, I don't recall a thing 
And all in all I guess it's for the better 
If you don't remember anything, sit and sing 
There was a time when everything we did seemed second nature 
There was a time when everything we did seemed free 
And all in all I guess it's for the better 
If you don't remember anything, sit and sing 
And I wanted you to know 
It was you that we were thinking of as we quietly died in the snow 
A place we'd never leave 
A place we'd never want to call home 
A place we'd call a final resting place in pieces 
So we began this way, I don't recall where we got started 
And so we end this way no trace of us in spring 
All in all, I guess it's for the better if you just can't feel a fucking thing 
Fall asleep and die 
And I wanted you to know 
It was you that we were thinking of as we quietly died in the snow 
A place we'd never leave 
A place we'd never want to call home 
A place we'd call a final resting place in pieces 
And I wanted you to know 
It was you that we were thinking of as we quietly died in the snow 
A place we'd never leave 
A place we'd never want to call home 
A place we'd call a final resting place in pieces
