What does DONE look like? (Project outcome.)

Think In Advance.
Move from Hope to Trust. (Unconscious to Conscious.)
Stop hoping that you have it all captured & processed, and Trust the system.
See the Forest and the Tree - know that you're hugging the right tree.
Use the System to maintain the productive process.
Areas of responsibility are different than projects - 20k vs 10k.
Project planning - just the single NA or a set of sequential NAs, or parallel NAs?
Productive Experience - things feel better without actually completing anything - how I relate to the project/stuff has changed.
Ending of Meetings - Last 10-15 minutes is definitions of NAs & outcomes.
Horizontal Control at a Level of Work creates Vertical Perspective.
Define Job Description every 6 months or every job change. (February)

Define projects in past tense, how it will look when it's done.
Waiting for includes date of hand-off, and date of acknowledgement of receipt of hand-off.
"Decide" isn't a NA - you need more info or more time, which is it?
"Think About" isn't a NA, that's what processing is. (Is there a brainstorm?)
@ANYWHERE context
"Delegate it up."
Yearly purge of A-Z file system.
Weekly Review also reviews last weeks calendar & next weeks calendar.
Where am I with this project, does it need more attention?
After Project & Calendar review, go through Someday-Maybe.
