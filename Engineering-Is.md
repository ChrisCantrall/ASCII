Engineering Is

The Art & Science of Structural Engineering is ensuring that things whose shape we don't truly know, which are made of materials we do not fully understand, are able to withstand situations we can never fully know, all while making the thing lightweight, corrosion resistant, easy to build, easy to repair, hard to misuse, durable, damage tolerant, and inexpensive.


"Engineering is the art of modelling materials we do not wholly understand into shapes we cannot precisely analyse, so as to withstand forces we cannot properly assess, in such a way that the public has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance."

- Dr. A. R. Dykes, 1976, to the British Institute of Structural Engineers.

Engineering is the art of building cost-effective solutions to problems that society regards as significant.
