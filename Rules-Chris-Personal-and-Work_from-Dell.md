Experienced person: "Our old plan assumed nothing was on fire. That's why everything is on fire now."

Everyone: "This new plan assumes everything's always on fire."

00. Care.

01. Get The Data. 
(Data, data, data - I cannot make bricks without clay. Sherlock Holmes.) 
02. The Model is not the Drawing. The Drawing is not the Structure.
03. Do the FBD. With a pencil. (A Balanced FBD has ALL the loads on it.) 
04. Safe. Compliant. Economical. In that order. 
05. Step back. Do a larger FBD. Strain? Spring rate? Load path?
06. Go with your first instinct. Unless it's a cop-out. (Jim Manlove) 
07. Clarity is our greatest product. (Craig Dyson) 
The goal in technical writing is not to be possible to understand, but to be hard to misunderstand. (John D. Cook) 
08. Failure is the default, Success takes work.
09. You can always do better. And worse.

10. Sometimes the windmill loses. (Ralph S. Jackson III) 
11. Everyone makes mistakes. 
12. 
13. Customers can be stupid, and sometimes evil.
14. Customers will catch every mistake you made.
15. Check EVERYTHING.
16. You will miss something. Everyone does.
17. No one reads it until they sign it.

22. 
23. 
24. Nothing matters until it gets an Owner, a Deadline, and a Budget. 
25. You get what you've got.
You will never get refined or updated dates, costs, or estimates - work to the worst version of them, and ask for better versions. (Alex will be here in April.) 
26.

29. 

30. 
31. Set people up for success. 
32. You were not set up for success.

When someone of demonstrated skill makes a mistake, kindly show them the mistake, and then do not mention it again. Hovering or obvious watching only makes them nervous, and they make more mistakes. Quietly observe them, inconspicuously - praise any job done well, and be ready to correct them gently if they stumble again.

When wishing for a pony, have a stable & some feed ready. Just in case. (paraphrase of Ralph S. Jackson III)

Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up. Never give in. - The Doctors' promise, The Day of the Doctor. 

The part GEOMETRY made of a certain MATERIAL must be acceptable for the applied LOADS, using acceptable METHODS, applied by an ENGINEER. It's someone sitting on a 3 legged stool: the Geometry, Material, and Loads are the legs of the stool, the Methods are the seat of the stool. The Engineer sits on the stool. 

THOUGHTS AND IDEAS


Rule on precision: it's possible / required for some fields / subjects, and if you/they aren't practiced in communicating accurately and precisely then you/they may "not be able" to communicate that way. ... Poorly put. 


Lesson Learned for inter-group cooperation: If there is no formal requirement, they won't do anything.
This was from Mike McDonalds 27 July 2015 presentation “Update on Pressure Prevention Means and Residual Pressure” – it was an off-hand comment about ECS changing something we relied on. I mentioned it because off-hand comments are the ones I use the most.

Richard said that he learned on the 767 program that we don't really understand the relationships between pressure and mechanism.
This was from this Monday 3 August 2015 during Richard’s discussion of his 767 experience.


The model is not the drawing. 
The drawing is not the structure.

The model is not the drawing. 
The drawing is not the structure built. 
The structure built is not the structure in service. 


Look at it from the customer's perspective. 


John D. Cook: Boredem is the curse of the Competant.


simple rules must meet four conditions: They must be limited in number, tailored to the person or organization using them, applied to well-defined activities, and open to giving people latitude to exercise discretion.

The authors identify two types of simple rules: Those that can help you make decisions and those that can help you do things.

The authors say the simple rules can be applied to work and personal challenges through a three-step process:

Define what you want to do
Choose a bottleneck
Craft the rules

Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. 

The expert did it better.

The most expensive thing is failure. -Alex Lindsay, MBW 380 at 1:56:55, recorded 10 December 2013.

If you don't do something in house, where do you do it? ... - John Frey, 16 December 2013

If you think getting it right is expensive, wait and see what happens when you get it wrong. - John Frey, 2013

Corrosion is Father Time's way of shoving you down Mother Nature's digestive tract. - John Frey

You're in charge, if there's something wrong, you probably screwed up a while ago.

In the absence of information, people make shit up. - Michael Lopp, http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-rands-test/


There's a difference between writing it down and writing it up.
