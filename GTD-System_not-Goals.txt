Ideas for GTD, growth, Systems not Goals, etc.

Dr. Drang, May 2018
At the beginning of every month, I make a new TaskPaper document, filling it with the uncompleted tasks from the previous month. In this way, the documents from the previous months are a record of what I was planning to do and what I finished.
