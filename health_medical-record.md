Picked up ciprofloxacin (anti-biotic) at pharmacy. Pharmacist said 2 per day, 12 hours apart, and try taking without food first (if I get a stomach ache, food is OK). But no dairy or other pills in the 2 hours before or after the pill.

Went to walk in clinic at Silver Lake for slight left kidney pain. Dr. Cyrus Rafii did urine test looking for blood, but found 5-10 white bloods in the field of view (Normal is 0-1, dozens to hundreds is a raging kidney infection.), so I might have an infection. Urine culture performed (took too long to get results) and ciprofloxacin (anti-biotic) prescribed.

Feel nauseous, don't know how I react to (artificial?) nausea, working from home. ... Hmm, I made an omelet last night from eggs "Best used by July 3". That might have something to do with this morning's nausea.

Left ankle pain & swelling. Dr. Mark Saffitz at Silver Lake walk in clinic. Probably sprain - the swelling is warm. Will rule out gout with test for uric acid. Also an ankle air splint. Anti-inflammatory 2x a day for 10 days. 

Also examined right wrist (after reading history), thinks I started using it too soon. Anti-inflammatory for ankle will help wrist, even just the 10 day period. 

For both ankle & wrist he had the same admonition : Use it, don't abuse it. If it hurts, stop. If it hurts later, don't do it.

When did I go to the emergency room for heart problems? 2012? Sunday March 4, 2012. 


2012-09-19_15-46-28
Appointment with Dr. Carter. 

I have Flexible Flat Feet, which aren't a health concern. He suggested trying Dr. Scholes inserts (or another brand) for a while, and when they break down (which they do quickly), talk to the podiatrist for durable inserts. 

Blood pressure is still OK, & I'm losing weight. 

The flap on my nose is OK, if I want it removed it will leave a scar twice as big as the base, and take a year to fully heal. 

The spot on my left temple would worry him if it's growing. I said I'd take a photo again in 6 months, to compare it to the one I took when mom noticed it. 

Dr. said he doesn't think 2 Daily vitamins are needed, but he'd take 2 doses of glucosamine daily anyway - regardless of how much I weigh.

General advice on Ice & Heat:
Ice on muscles for 20 minutes, wait an hour or two before more ice. Chem pacs take a whole to refreeze, and don't melt as fast as ice.
