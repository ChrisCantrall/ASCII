Continual review, splitting the Weekly Review up to reduce "Big Project Avoidance". Growth in/with Christ is a project/Role/Goal/vision/value. Hi. 

*****

GTD is picking a time to make the most of my decisions (when I have the ability (time/attention/energy) to decide), writing it down (where I can get it when I need it), and acting on those decisions (when I don't have time, or energy, or desire to decide). Perfect. I can postpone decisions until I'm able to make them. But I am not (yet) able to do a week's worth of decisions at once, I need decisions to (come / force themselves on me) in smaller chunks, with fewer decisions to make at once. Since I can't reduce the number of decisions without reducing my quality of life to ... what it is now / has been for a while, I have to decide more often, with each Decision Batch containing fewer decisions. Ergo, Daily Deciding. Decide Today.

Have enough play /slop in the system to allow missing 2 days with no larger workload on the third day. If a larger workload happens, it should be in a few days.

Haven't used my decider in a dozen years.

3. Is each Role in the Notes description for at least One Project? (Create Search Perspectives. How many? Script? Save many URLs that conduct searches?)
* If that One Project isn't Active, is there a Good Reason? Will it be Active soon? Use "Defered_P" perspective.
* If there are no Paused or Active projects for that Role, add an action (Drafts + "pmeta") in "Roles with no Projects" Action in "GTD Maint" Project for the Monthly Review. 
4. Look in perspective ∆project-pause (Project-P) for recently paused projects, change Review Interval to 3 months if recently paused.

# Notes

Split the Weekly Review into tiny Daily Boosts and a Weekly Review.

The seed of this project was planted around March 2013, but it took it's final form (final as of 2014-07-17) in Spring 2014.

WHY? To reduce Big Project Avoidance.

Actions, Projects, Areas of Focus, avoidance, anxiety, physical health ...

I need a weekly mental self evaluation. 
What am I avoiding? Why? How? 
How do I confront that more regularly?

What are the aspects of the Weekly Review?

DAILY:

* Morning: Flag what I want to work on today.
* Evening: cleanup, ... ?

OUTCOME: All open loops are fully identified, clarified, assessed, and actionalized. Assess my life and work at the appropriate horizons, making the appropriate decisions, at the appropriate intervals, in order to really come clean. Be up to date enough and confident enough to quit my job in one conversation (like Kate at Palace and J. Anderson with Steve Johnson).

All projects have an OUTCOME, a GOAL, and a ROLE in the notes.
OUTCOME

* Short project titles which are easy to deal with, and a very clearly defined "I'm done" state written in the project on my iPhone.
* An intentional connection between each Project and the Role it supports.

Biological term for something that doesn't grow - dead.

Workflow

* Capture
* Clarify
* Organize
* Review
* Do


Confrontation sequence:
1. Do I still want to do this?
2. Why didn't I do it yet?
3. How can I do it?


Projects are NOUN based outcomes. 
Actions are VERB based activities.

## Evaluating Horizons with respect to other horizons

A Daily Review examines 
Runway (Next Actions)
with respect to 
10,000' (Projects & Next Actions) 


A Weekly Review examines 
10,000' (Projects & Next Actions) 
with respect to 
20,000' (Roles / Areas of Focus)


A Monthly Review examines 
20,000' (Roles / Areas of Focus) 
with respect to 
30,000' (Goals & Objectives in 3-24 months)
What has to happen sooner to make that later & larger plan possible?


A Quarterly Review examines 
30,000' (Goals & Objectives in 3-24 months)
with respect to 
40,000' (Vision, Strategy, and Ideal Scenarios in 2-5 years).
What the Purpose looks like, consistent with my Principles.


A Yearly Review examines 
40,000' (Vision, Strategy, and Ideal Scenarios in 2-5 years) 
with respect to 
50,000' (Life Purpose & Guiding Principles / Bucket List).

I regularly come back to my own daily schedule to re-evaluate it and see if it is serving me as well as it should be. Because schedules, like finances, make excellent slaves but horrible masters. I should be the one who sets my schedule and budgets my time just like I should be the one budgeting my finances. A schedule, like a budget, is there for the purpose of serving my goals so that the minutes don’t get away from me and I end up squandering my time.
