# Facing Anger, Norman Rohrer and S. Philip Sutherland
P 55; Ch 4
The desire to feel powerful results from a deficit of peer. Anger is an attempt to get it back. 
56
Psychotherapy begins its constructive phase when people are prepared to admit that they are needy, and not until then. 
60
Unfulfilled need is intolerable. It is demeaning. It makes people angry. 
62
If God needed the seventh day to rest from his creative activities, perhaps mere humans need at least that much. We *can't* do it all. We need vacations, rest time for our own pleasures, and, **most of all, a willingness to call on other people for help.**
64
People always disappoint. 
65
Anger is a response that people choose rather than face their feelings of helplessness and dependency. They would rather become angry than realize their limitations. 
People who are not afraid of feeling helpless at times have no need to be angry when their helplessness is presented to them. They do what they can about a situation and feel no remorse over what they cannot do. 
p67, ch 6
... combination of anger and sadness called depression. 
p84, ch 7
[Chronic confessors ... sounds like me.]


From talking to Dan Hartman - 
Synthesizing Anger is combining it with something else, like Love, or wisdome, or judgement, so that you donâ€™t react badly.

End of Facing Anger is psycho Dynamic therapy about relationships with other people. Dan has been concentrating on my relationship with myself - deep breathing, positive self talk, etc.

# Liberal Fascism #

Jonah Goldberg

The elements that fit the Fascist playbook. (ch 6, p211)

>The creation of crises, nationalistic appeals to unity, celebration of martial values, the blurring of lines between public and private sectors, the utilization of mass media to glamorize the State and it's programs, invocations of a new "post-partisan" spirit that places the important decisions in the hands of experts and intellectual supermen, and a cult of personality for the national leader.

# Wheel of Time #

WoT people beg or lord it over people, depending on whether they have more power or less than the other people. I find this abhorrent. Is that because I'm used to no one having the power to hurt me without consequence? Does a Judeo Christian foundation for my society (where the lowliest servant can have the same close relationship with The Creator that the upper class does) instill a greater sense of self worth than a society without that connection to God?
